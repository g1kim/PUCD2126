        ARTnews: How did you see Marci a Tucker's aim as distinct from yours?
        </p>
        <p>Heiss: She wanted to copy the museum [concept] exactly
but have it be a more important museum. She was relating to
GertrudeV anderbilt Whitney and other figures in the past
whos tarted over. So she made a template for a museum, which
includeda collection, docents. She kept trying to bang her new
museumin to some sort of shape, like a spaceship . She had a
lot of things that I didn 't have, but mostly things I didn't want.
EverythingI had, she didn't want, except for one thing: space.
Sheh ad no space; I had a lot of space. In that sense, we were
completelym ismatched. Strangely, and sadly, we never talked
muchI. liked her very much, and I thought of her well. But
she had so little to do with the artists I was working with . She
wasnp't roducing sculpture or producing big shows . She was
involvewd ith a classical museum of contemporary art.

ART news: Both are now non-coll ecting institut ion s. In what
nys is that an asset and also maybe a liabili ty?
Heiss:W hen Marcia started, she emphatically had it be a
collectingin stitution . I was emphatically "no." I can't do the
collectingt hing. It's just not in my blood. We would have had a
phenomenal collection, had we done it.
Gioni: Maybe we would have been buried by the sense of
responsibility. What distinguishes us [both], I think, is not
so much collecting or not. But both institutions have been
focusedo n exhibition making-a certain type of exhibition
making where the exhibition and the content overlap
much more than they do [elsewhere]: the exhibition as an
experience, not a display of discrete objects. At P.S. 1, the
spacei tself was so present and so radical that you couldn't
just borrow some painting and put it on the wall. It was more
about making environments.
Heiss: Let me tell you a critical difference that does not
reflect so beautifully on me: Marcia, in spite of her museum
fetish, was incredibly political. She was a committed
political figure of the '60s and early '70s variety. She
believed she could make a difference, as a person and
as a leader. She would get behind causes and pull the
museum up to them, whatever cause she supported . She
was particularly interested in feminist activity and feminist
theory, which she bonded and represented in shows at
the New Museum. She was the first on the block to show
women doing this and women doing that . She was an icon
to many disadvantaged or marginalized groups . She also had
a lot of other interests: she had strong connections to the
major tattoo artists in New York City, and she did shows
of that. She also had a genuine interest in singing. Usually,
when you hear a mu seum director or curator sing, you go
the other way because there's not a single piece of evidence
of one person who is a good singer-

          ART news: D o both of you fall in lin e with that trend?
Gioni: I was a singer when I was a teenager, for a few bands.
Heiss: I went to a conservatory of music, so I know what bad
singers really are.

ART news: Massi miliano , the New Museum was an upstart
project at the beginnin g, but now it's an institution . How
much do you think ofl egacy and hi storic al context from an
operational standpo int?
Gioni: There is a quote from Claude Levi-Strauss: he said-or
this is how I remember it-"There is no such a thing as a history
of something, only a history for someone ." In the past few years
since the museum opened [ on the Bowery], a lot of people say
what our history was, and each has their own interpretation
and their own fantasy. It's interesting to hear from Alanna
that, in her mind, the New Museum from the beginning had
an institutional aspiration. I think many people have idealized
the idea of the New Museum being scrappy. In other words, I
think the combination of the alternative and the mainstream
was more complicated then than people now understand. Going
back to music, I grew up intellectually in the '90s, so I come
from a generation that witnessed the end of what used to be
the underground. Two defining moments in my life were Sonic
Youth signing with Geffen and Nirvana leaving Sub Pop.
        </p>
        <p>
ART news: D efining how?
Gioni: There is a moment in the '90s when the idea of the
underground and the mainstream completely dissolved. I'm
nostalgic about it, but I can also say, sadly, that Kurt Cobain was
taking the same drugs before and after Geffen, and the music was
also great before and after, and he reached out to more people. I
see the New Museum today, as it has emerged, as going through
that transformation. It is a sort of alternative institution that I
hope has its heart in the right place, has the right agendas, and has
an interest in different voices still very much alive that can speak
to a larger audience less attached to an idea of an underground
that doesn't exist anymore. That is more complicated than a certain
nostalgia wants to assert.
