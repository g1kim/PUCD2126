      <p class=subtitle>A 10-star 2-hour movie screaming to get out of a 7-star 3-hour movie

        Let me be the first to admit that there's nothing wrong with a long movie, nothing at all.
        "Titanic" was a long movie that was as exactly as long as it needed to be. "Gone with the Wind" was a really
        long movie that was exactly as long as it needed to be. "Dances with Wolves" was a long movie that I wish had
        been even longer when I saw it in the theater. But "King Kong"? Phhewww...this sucker clocks in at least 30-60
        minutes longer than it needs to be. While it played, I kept inadvertently thinking to myself, "Boy, we really should
        be out to sea by now...they haven't reached the island yet?...man, are they EVER gonna find Ann?...jeez, when are we
        gonna go back to Manhattan already?..." and so on. Hand to God--I actually yawned twice during the last third of this
         movie. I even closed my eyes for a second before I realized, 'hey...you can't just rewind this when you wake up!'
        Sure, many scenes in "King Kong" were thrilling (e.g., LOVED the T-Rex sequence) and, yes, I even teared up a little
        a couple of times. And I must say, Kong himself was beautifully realized--he looked and acted like a REAL gorilla
        (albeit a tiny bit anthropomorphized)! But I gotta tell you...I was more relieved than exhilarated when this movie
        ended. (If I saw one more flyover of the native village, I was gonna scream!) Peter...baby...why spend so much time
        developing all these extraneous secondary characters if you don't really have much closure with them by the end.
        For example, the ship's captain and Jimmy...once we leave Skull Island...pfffftttt...we never them again. Why all
        the backstory scenes about them? As with the original version, Jackson should have concentrated simply on the four
         main characters throughout: Kong, Ann, Driscoll and Denham. Period.
        The problem is Jackson tried to make an epic out of a thriller, when these two approaches are generally exclusive
        to each other. The original "Kong" MOVED because it was simply a thriller and content to be so, but Jackson's remake
        starts and stops, and starts and stops, and starts and stops, merely frustrating the thrillseeker in us that wants to
        keep going every time Jackson establishes some momentum. But instead Jackson pauses to "delve" or "explore" or "elaborate" a la David Lean or something like that. One can excuse Jackson for shooting so much material for the "Lord of the Rings" trilogy--consider the rich source material . But how anyone could have taken the 100-minute original and nearly doubled it for a remake has far too much memory on his Mac. He should have saved all the extra footage (and I'm betting there's a LOT more we didn't see in the theatrical cut) for the DVD release as he did for LOTR. Mr. Jackson's first priority as a
         filmmaker (well, all filmmakers) is to present the most appropriate cut for THEATRICAL audiences during the film's
         initial exhibition in theaters. In this case, more WAS less. Much shorter movies in the past have had intermissions!
        Honestly, though I certainly enjoyed "King Kong", I really have no desire to see this movie again--I just couldn't
        bring myself to sit through all the filler just to get to the good parts. How I wish Jackson and/or Universal would
        consider releasing a 2-hour DVD version. Hey, it's happened before, so what's the harm? Inside of a year there'll be
        17 versions out on DVD anyway...what's one more? But having to sit through a 3-4 hour DVD version someday? I'll take
         a pass.
        Do I recommend seeing "King Kong"? Of course. You'll probably enjoy it immensely, despite it's overlength. But if
         you do go, by all means lay off the Jumbo Coke until at least 90 minutes in! You'll thank me later.

Peter Jackson gave this movie a new twist. I 've seen the old King Kong movies and they're quite great, but this one is exceptional!! The actors and actress Naomi gave the movie its own character and distinct traits from the original story. It fits them so well, but the most remarkable in this movie is KONG. Peter made the beast look like a real, living gorilla, only it's 25 feet tall. The actor who portrayed Kong is great. He gives the beast life, not just its brute strength and uncanny agility, but a heart of beast that is longing for a companion. In his eyes you can see the soul that suffers from the savagery of the island, but his love for Ann, he finds his way to conquer it. There are many scenes in this movie that will capture your heart and even make you cry. It's up for you to see. This movie is worth seeing for. This is a great remake from a great director (",).
I get to see a lot of movies early due to my employment at a media group, whether I like it or not, but I actually had to finagle my way into a screening of Logan.
And thank god.
Logan is a film which I consider it a privilege to have seen. When you see the film, you'll understand. This is a FILM, not a super hero movie.
For years, fans have yearned for an honest to God Wolverine movie, and we got damn close with Mangold's The Wolverine, a few years prior. This time, after Deadpool paved the way for R Rated X-Men films, Fox have finally gotten out of the way.
Logan is a gnarly, emotional and honest film about Wolverine. Hugh Jackman carries the movie in a minimalist, yet terrifying performance. This movie has everything, yes there is gore and f-bombs, but also a story. James Mangold has taken elements of the acclaimed "Old Man Logan", and had created a masterpiece. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but suffice it to say that Logan is now THE definitive comic book movie, in my mind, unseating Zack Snyder's Watchmen.
This movie is exactly what I needed it to be and god bless it.
Do yourself a favor and watch this film.
