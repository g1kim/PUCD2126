Logan is the 2017 movie everyone has been anticipating after two great trailers and a R rating it delivers a surprising amount of heart to characters we have grown to love and know and also balancing a surprising amount of action within the first and third act climax, its violent but not blood for blood sake every cut is with reason.

Logan presents us with Logan (Wolverine), Professor X and Laura (X-23) and by definition its an escort mission involving X-23 but shes more capable than Logan and Professor X thinks and shes able to fend for herself. Logan is old and a grizzled shadow of what he once was and by going on this mission he unlocks some of the old wolverine inside of him and we see bursts of that throughout the movie, Logan also begins to realize things about himself through the vision of this little girl because they have striking similarities.

Every scene in this film feels necessary from the character development to the humor and action nothing is forced everything comes off natural which is a breath of fresh air and I was very pleased with it, I believe that this movie will be very well received by fans as it treats its characters with such care and embarks on an emotional and satisfying conclusion to Hugh Jackmans Logan (Wolverine).

I was really looking forward to this film. Not only has Disney recently made excellent live-action versions of
        their animated masterpieces (Jungle Book, Cinderella), but the cast alone (Emma Watson, Ian McKellen, Kevin Kline)
        already seemed to make this one a sure hit. Well, not so much as it turns out.
Some of the animation is fantastic, but because characters like Cogsworth (the clock), Lumi√®re (the candelabra) and Chip
(the little tea cup) now look "realistic", they lose a lot of their animated predecessors' charm and actually even
look kind of creepy at times. And ironically - unlike in the animated original - in this new realistic version they
only have very limited facial expressions (which is a creative decision I can't for the life of me understand).
Even when it works: there can be too much of a good thing. The film is overstuffed with lush production design and
cgi (which is often weirdly artificial looking though) but sadly lacking in charm and genuine emotion. If this were
a music album, I'd say it is "over-produced" and in need of more soul and swing. The great voice talent in some cases
actually seems wasted, because it drowns in a sea of visual effects that numbs all senses. The most crucial thing that
didn't work for me, though, is the Beast. He just never looks convincing. The eyes somehow don't look like real eyes and
they're always slightly off.
On the positive side, I really liked Gaston, and the actor who played him, Luke Evans, actually gave the perhaps most
energized performance of all. Kevin Kline as Belle's father has little to do but to look fatherly and old, but he makes
the most of his part. Speaking of Belle, now that I've seen the film, I think her role was miscast. I think someone like
Rachel McAdams would actually have been a more natural, lively and perhaps a bit more feisty Belle than Emma Watson.
If you love the original, you might want to give this one a pass, it's really not that good (although at least the songs
were OK). Also, I'd think twice before bringing small children; without cute animated faces, all those "realistic" looking
creatures and devices can be rather frightening for a child.

  <p class=subtitle>At long last. This is what we needed.

I get to see a lot of movies early due to my employment at a media group, whether I like it or not, but I actually had to finagle my way into a screening of Logan.
And thank god.
Logan is a film which I consider it a privilege to have seen. When you see the film, you'll understand. This is a FILM, not a super hero movie.
For years, fans have yearned for an honest to God Wolverine movie, and we got damn close with Mangold's The Wolverine, a few years prior. This time, after Deadpool paved the way for R Rated X-Men films, Fox have finally gotten out of the way.
Logan is a gnarly, emotional and honest film about Wolverine. Hugh Jackman carries the movie in a minimalist, yet terrifying performance. This movie has everything, yes there is gore and f-bombs, but also a story. James Mangold has taken elements of the acclaimed "Old Man Logan", and had created a masterpiece. I'm not going to spoil anything here, but suffice it to say that Logan is now THE definitive comic book movie, in my mind, unseating Zack Snyder's Watchmen.
This movie is exactly what I needed it to be and god bless it.
Do yourself a favor and watch this film.
