      <p>Disney's animated classic takes on a new form, with a widened mythology and an all-star cast.
         A young prince, imprisoned in the form of a beast, can be freed only by true love. What may be his
         only opportunity arrives when he meets Belle, the only human girl to ever visit the castle since it was
         enchanted. Written by IMDb Editor

      <p class=subtitle>Overstuffed and lacks the charm of the original

      <p>5/10

      <p>I was really looking forward to this film. Not only has Disney recently made excellent live-action versions of
        their animated masterpieces (Jungle Book, Cinderella), but the cast alone (Emma Watson, Ian McKellen, Kevin Kline)
        already seemed to make this one a sure hit. Well, not so much as it turns out.
Some of the animation is fantastic, but because characters like Cogsworth (the clock), Lumi√®re (the candelabra) and Chip
(the little tea cup) now look "realistic", they lose a lot of their animated predecessors' charm and actually even
look kind of creepy at times. And ironically - unlike in the animated original - in this new realistic version they
only have very limited facial expressions (which is a creative decision I can't for the life of me understand).
Even when it works: there can be too much of a good thing. The film is overstuffed with lush production design and
cgi (which is often weirdly artificial looking though) but sadly lacking in charm and genuine emotion. If this were
a music album, I'd say it is "over-produced" and in need of more soul and swing. The great voice talent in some cases
actually seems wasted, because it drowns in a sea of visual effects that numbs all senses. The most crucial thing that
didn't work for me, though, is the Beast. He just never looks convincing. The eyes somehow don't look like real eyes and
they're always slightly off.
On the positive side, I really liked Gaston, and the actor who played him, Luke Evans, actually gave the perhaps most
energized performance of all. Kevin Kline as Belle's father has little to do but to look fatherly and old, but he makes
the most of his part. Speaking of Belle, now that I've seen the film, I think her role was miscast. I think someone like
Rachel McAdams would actually have been a more natural, lively and perhaps a bit more feisty Belle than Emma Watson.
If you love the original, you might want to give this one a pass, it's really not that good (although at least the songs
were OK). Also, I'd think twice before bringing small children; without cute animated faces, all those "realistic" looking
creatures and devices can be rather frightening for a child.

  <p class=subtitle>    A Joy to behold

    While I have deep respect for anyone's honest opinion of movies, I have to say I rarely "review" a movie for technical acumen. I think about the only movie I've ever done that with was Star Trek 5 in which one of my best friends and I felt like Siskel and Ebert at the back of the theater picking the thing to pieces.
    Granted, that movie was easy to do that to. This movie was an absolute joy to behold! I've heard talk of distractions etc with the Beast in their effort to keep a touch of humanity to his otherwise inhuman face, but I just didn't care. It was joyous. Ewan McGreggor nearly steals the movie as LeFluer, and Emma Watson is a delight.
    Probably above all, the nonsense of Lefoo (sp?) is nonsense! Yes he was clearly gay in the movie, but I did not care one iota. Go see it, and don't try to judge, try to enjoy. Probably the easiest thing you'll do.
